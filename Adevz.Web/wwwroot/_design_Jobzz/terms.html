Umee Media&rsquo;s, Jobzz, is not an employer or staffing agency. We collect small processing fees to mutually connect users on our application much like a real-time classifieds service. Using any feature or function on our application will collectively be hereinafter the &ldquo;Services.&rdquo;</p>

                      <p>MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

                </div>

                      <p>OVERVIEW</p>
                      <p>Umee Media, LLC collects information for analytical and marketing purposes while our mobile applications are in use.

                      <p>SCOPE AND APPLICATION</p>
                      <p>This Privacy Statement (&ldquo;Statement") applies to persons anywhere who use our app or Services to perform gigs and to persons seeking gig performers. This statement does not apply to information we collect from or about users, couriers, or any other persons who use Jobzz.</p>

                      <p>CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 16</p>
                      <p>Our app is not meant for children under 16 years of age. No one the under age 16 may give any personal data to or on the app. We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under 16.</p>

                      <p>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
                      <p>Umee Media collects personal data from you during the course of your application and for, and use of, the Umee Media, including location data, which information may be stored, processed, and/or accessed by Umee Media, as well as its service providers, for business purposes, including for marketing, lead generation, service development and improvement, analytics, industry and market research, and such other purposes consistent with Umee Media&rsquo;s and its Affiliates&rsquo; legitimate business needs. By submitting information to Umee Media during the application process and/or by using the Services, you consent to such collection and use of personal data. This information may include but is not limited to: legal name, email, telephone number, postal address, payment information/method, items requested (for delivery services), delivery notes, as well as other information you choose to provide.</p>

                      <p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
                      <p>When you use our Services we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
                      <p>Location Information: When you use Umee Media, we collect precise location data. If you permit the Umee Media app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (&ldquo;platform&rdquo;), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. Our purpose for requesting, monitoring, and saving such information is for the sole purpose of protecting our users.<br />Contacts Information: If you permit the Umee Media application to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.<br />Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, and other related transaction details.<br />Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.<br />Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.<br />Call and SMS Data: Our Services facilitate communications between Users. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties&rsquo; phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.<br />Log Information: When you interact with the Services we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</p>
                      <p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS</p>
                      <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent, and these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Umee Media app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. The Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Umee Media app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constituting through your consent. These alerts and notifications will aid the Services in learning about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we&rsquo;ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>

                      <p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</p>
                      <p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:</p>
                      <p>If you choose to link, create, or log into your Umee Media account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.<br />When you request on demand services, our Keeperz will provide Umee Media with a rating after services are provided by a Busy Bee.</p>
                      <p>USE OF INFORMATION</p>
                      <p>We may use the information we collect about you to:</p>
                      <p>Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to facilitate payments, send receipts, provide products and services you request (and send related information), develop new features, provide customer support to Users, develop safety features, authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;<br />Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends;<br />Send or facilitate communications (i) between gig requestors and gig performers, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), or (ii) between users at their directions in connection with use of certain features, such as referrals, invites, or ETA sharing;<br />Send you communications we think will be of interest to you, including information about products, services, promotions, news, and events of Umee Media, LLC and other companies, where permissible and according to local applicable laws; and to process contest, sweepstake, or other promotion entries and fulfill any related awards;<br />Personalize and improve the Services, including to provide or recommend features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements.</p>
                      <p>We may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process and store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.</p>

                      <p>USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SERVICES &amp; OTHER MEANS</p>
                      <p>We may share your information as described in this Statement or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:</p>
                      <p>With Busy Beez to enable them to provide the Services you request. For example, we share your name, photo, average user rating, and pickup and/or drop-off locations with Keeperz;<br />With Keeperz, we share your name, photo, and pickup and/or drop-off locations with Busy Beez;<br />With the general public if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog comments, social media posts, or other features of our Services that are viewable by the general public;<br />With third parties with whom you choose to let us share information, for example, other apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate.<br />With Umee Media, LLC subsidiaries and affiliated entities that provide services or conduct data processing on our behalf, or for data centralization and / or logistics purposes.<br />With vendors, consultants, marketing partners, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<br />In response to a request for information by a competent authority if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process;<br />With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User agreements, Terms of Service, or policies, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Umee Media or others;<br />In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company;<br />If we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing; and<br />In an aggregated and/or anonymized form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
                      <p>SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES</p>
                      <p>The Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service.</p>

                      <p>ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS</p>
                      <p>We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and services.</p>

                      <p>LOCATION INFORMATION</p>
                      <p>We request permission for our app&rsquo;s collection of precise location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app&rsquo;s collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to collect your location information from a Keeper or Busy Bee device nor our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.</p>

                      <p>CONTACT INFORMATION</p>
                      <p>We may also seek permission for our app&rsquo;s collection and syncing of contact information from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, iOS users can later disable it by changing the contacts settings on your mobile device. Currently, the Android platform does not provide such a setting.</p>

                      <p>CHANGES TO THE STATEMENT</p>
                      <p>We may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Statement, we will provide you notice through the Services or by some other means, such as email. Your continued use of the Services after such notice constitutes your consent to the changes. We encourage you to periodically review the Statement for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
